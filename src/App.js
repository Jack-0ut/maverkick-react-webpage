                  <p className="ideology">We see any skill or knowledge as a house. And every lesson you take is like a brick. There are many different sizes of the bricks, but we are having an opinion that smaller is better. It comes from our life experience, as we're seeing how our lives are decided in momentary situations, short conversations or just a second look in the eye. But our learning nowadays doesn't look like that - we've been told that more is better and we have to go through hours of the materials, which is hard to assimilate. And that's why we go to social media, where everything is so fast,bright and funny. And that's why many of us feels depressed when we need to learn. And that's why we're creating this. That's why our goal is to  <strong> give people those small bricks and teach them how to use it to build whatever they want.</strong></p>
